# Coding-Challenge

## Objective

Your job is to build a method that processes a given tic tac toe board and figures out the winner.
You will receive a multi-dimensional array containing a filled out tic tac toe board.
The array will be similar to
```
[
    ["X", "X", "X"],
    ["O", "O", "O"],
    ["X", "X", "X"]
]
```
You must take this array and figure out who won the game. Once you have figured out who won you will simply return your results.
So if O wins your return would be a string "O", and Vice-Versa for "X".
If there is a draw, you should return "-" to signify no winner.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository to your own github account. If you do not have one, you can create one for free.
1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
1. Open the solution using visual studio.
1. In the solution you should see a file called TicTacToe.cs, within that you will find a method ProcessWinner(string[,] board), this is the method you should add your code to.
1. You can check your progress at anytime by running all tests in the solution.
1. Once finished you should commit and push your changes to your github repository and then send the link back for verification.

### Additional Notes

_**Note: "O" is a capital o and not a zero.
